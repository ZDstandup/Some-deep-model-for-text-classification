# Some-deep-model-for-text-classification
This project is a simple conclusion of some deep model for document classification. As for these model implementations, i mainly referred brightmart (https://github.com/brightmart). I studyed them and coded them by myself. So here i have a conclusion to have review one day.


This project include some deep models for text classification.

1. CNN for text
2. RNN/LSTM/GRU for text
3. char CNN for text
4. RCNN for text
5. HAN for text

------------------------------------------------
These models can be applied to text classification/ text representation/ and information retrival and so on.

These project was just for my review.
